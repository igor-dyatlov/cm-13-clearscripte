# Nexusfication
Cleaning script for custom firmware. Replacing files ringtones, bootanimation, configuration files on the stock of official images.

If you love Google services and custom firmware, then this script is for you. It removes preinstalled applications AOSP and Cyanogen applications and allows you to replace them with Gapps.


## Support devices
- Galaxy Nexus
- Nexus 5
- Nexus 7 [2013] (Wi-Fi)

## Description
The script uses the files from the official firmware. Before using, make sure that you have replacement applications that have been deleted. I recommend to use [Open GApps](https://github.com/opengapps)
